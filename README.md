# üç∑ Wine Classification with K-Nearest Neighbors

# Description:
This dataset is a data set used to classify grape types based on chemical analysis results. The data comes from three types of grape cultivars from Italy grown in the same region of Italy. The purpose of this dataset is to classify grape samples into one of three cultivar classes based on 13 chemical attributes that can be used to confirm the authenticity of a wine and detect adulteration in the beverage industry.

# Goals:
1. Knowing the performance of the K Nearest Neighbors algorithm for determining wine classes.
2. Visualize the prediction results into a graph to facilitate understanding. 
3. Determine the column that has the most influence on the target prediction result.
